# PDF_merger

A simple tool to merge PDF files. A **Streamlit frontend** is currently under construction.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (cmd):
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can run the script to merge PDFs.

```bash
python pdf_merger.py
```

## Streamlit Frontend (Coming Soon)
A **Streamlit** interface is under development to make the tool more user-friendly.
